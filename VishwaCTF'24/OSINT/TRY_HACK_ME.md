# TRY HACK ME

## Description

TryHackMe is a browser-based cyber security training platform, with learning content covering all skill levels from the complete beginner to the seasoned hacker.

One of our team member is very active on the platform. Recently, I got to know that he comes under 3% in the global leaderboard. Impressive isn't it.

Maybe you should have a look at his profile

PS : He keeps his digital identity very simple. No fancy usernames. It's just a simple mathematics

His real name == His username
