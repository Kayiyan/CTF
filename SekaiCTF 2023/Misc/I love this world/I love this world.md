# I love this world

### _Points: 100_

### _Description:_

Vocaloid is a great software to get your computer sing the flag out to you, but what if you can’t afford it? No worries, there are plenty of other free tools you can use. How about — let’s say — this one?

Flag format (Regex): SEKAI\{[A-Z0-9]+\}.

> **Note:**
> 
> No romanization or Japanese translation is needed to solve the challenge. The flag you find will satisfy the flag regex. The flag in Japanese is a fake flag.
