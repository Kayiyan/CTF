Humm, this might related to the flag we need but i got flag when submit it : `Ã—y0u_r4b1d_d0g?!?!?!?!?!>/>?>?>12390jcapskdj091randomlettersandnumbersreeee2j3}` 

A little bit tricky is the word have meaning so let delete the 
`extra` characters like extra from the Description information 

Finnally , the correct flag is : `TFCCTF{y0u_r4b1d_d0g?!?!?!?!?!>/>?>?>12390jcapskdj091randomlettersandnumbersreeee2j3}`
